A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black
wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not
short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The machine is
designed so that both wires move around inside the machine. The black wire is
supposed to touch the battery at certain times as it moves around inside the
machine. The red wire is never supposed to touch the battery as it moves around
inside the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both come in
contact with the battery at the exact same time. There is a short circuit.
