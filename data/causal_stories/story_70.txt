Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message
that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend.
So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for
the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his
friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell
the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his
friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side
