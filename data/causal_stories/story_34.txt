Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's
security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am.
It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy
arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the

than one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector
went off.
