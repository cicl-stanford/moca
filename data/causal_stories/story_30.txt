Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee
flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free
sample if either they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC or they
are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee
beans from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears
about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email
list, and she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status,

sample if either they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC or they
are subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample.
