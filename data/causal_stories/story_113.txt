Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a
limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity
only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can

lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays.
