Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach
an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are
signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is red, so he is supposed
to stop and wait. Suzy's signal is green, so she is supposed to drive across
immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of
collapse. If they both drive their trains onto the bridge at the same time, it
will collapse. Neither train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge,
but both together will be too heavy for it. Billy decides to ignore his signal
and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy
follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto
the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses.
