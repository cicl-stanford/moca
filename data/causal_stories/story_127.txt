Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who
are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point
shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie
immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused
his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and
his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make
another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding
down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled
in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because
Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won
$100.
