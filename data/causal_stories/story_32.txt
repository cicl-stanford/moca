Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee
flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free
sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are
subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans
from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about
the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and
she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status, and she
subscribes to the email list. Because customers will receive a free sample if
both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are
subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample.
