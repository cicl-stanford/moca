An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that
the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series
of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he
decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer
the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the
hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to
confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off
requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist
receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and
immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same
time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although
some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are
also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side
effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this
drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off.
Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As
it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse
effects.
