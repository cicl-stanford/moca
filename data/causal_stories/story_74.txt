Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both
of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at
the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at
the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are
immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two
people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the
company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted
to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are
permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am,
Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time.
Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are
deleted from the central computer.
