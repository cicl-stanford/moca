Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who
are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point
shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie
immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled
in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his
friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another
shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down,
Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his
shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because
Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won
$100.
