Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll
two six-sided dice and flip a coin. Alex will either win or lose the game on
his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is
greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will
roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails.
Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes
up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins
the game.
