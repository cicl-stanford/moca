A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Both hedgehogs
and bears were allowed to take pencils. Both animals alternately took pencils
out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box
and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar
bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do its homework. However, there
were no pencils left in the box. Polar bear cannot finish his homework.
