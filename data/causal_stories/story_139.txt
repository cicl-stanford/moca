A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were
allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. Both
animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, both the
hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short
time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil
to do its homework. However, there were no pencils left in the box. Polar bear
cannot finish his homework.
