Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by
implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the
safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch
is off, and knob A is off. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and
he sees that it's off. So, he changes the position of knob A to the on
position. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off
and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM.
