David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty
minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to
HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not
set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the
temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets
the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would
dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or
the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty
minutes.
