A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black
wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not
short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is
designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire
is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black
wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There
is a short circuit.
