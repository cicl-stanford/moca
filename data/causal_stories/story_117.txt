Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a
limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity
only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can
use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time,
the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their
lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays.
Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim
turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on
his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps
at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.
