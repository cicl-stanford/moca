A person, Joe, is playing a casino game where he reaches his hand into two
boxes and blindly draws a ball from each box. He wins a dollar if and only if
he gets a green ball from the left box and a blue ball from the right box. It
is unlikely that he gets a green ball from the first box. It is very likely
that he gets a blue ball in the second box. Joe closes his eyes, reaches in,
and chooses a green ball from the first box and a blue ball from the second
box. So Joe wins a dollar.
