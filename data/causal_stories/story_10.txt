In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by
entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners.
During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other
team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone
without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing
Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one
point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree.
Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is allowed to talk to Runners,
Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the
Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the
remainder of the game.
