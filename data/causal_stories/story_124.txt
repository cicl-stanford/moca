A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy
of the final exam for their biology class. The students did not cheat on the
test. One student, John Granger, went along with the group. Granger follows the
norm and does not cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students
and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a
grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. Granger's score
was the 20th highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to
receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B,
and as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical
school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points.
