Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach
an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are
signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is green, so he is
supposed to drive across the bridge immediately. Suzy's signal is green, so she
is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the
bridge is on the verge of collapse. If they both drive their trains onto the
bridge at the same time, it will collapse. Neither train is heavy enough on its
own to break the bridge, but both together will be too heavy for it. Billy
follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same
time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both
trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge
collapses.
