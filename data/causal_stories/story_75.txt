Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both
of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at
the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at
the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are
immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one
person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued
the following official policy: Suzy is the only one permitted to log into the
central computer in the mornings, whereas Billy is the only one permitted to
log into the central computer in the afternoons. Billy is not permitted to log
into the central computer in the morning. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both
log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails
containing important customer information are deleted from the central
computer.
