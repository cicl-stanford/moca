Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both
of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company.
Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer
at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer
to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is
always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the
following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the
central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log
in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official
policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following
the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in.
Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent
email address.
