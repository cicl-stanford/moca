Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises.
He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully
charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. At 2:00
PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that
time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees
that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it
on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is
either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00
PM.
