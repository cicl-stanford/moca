A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were
allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The
hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced.
Therefore, the hedgehog knows about the new norm. Both animals alternately took
pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to
the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a
polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do its homework. However,
there were no pencils left in the box. Polar bear cannot finish his homework.
