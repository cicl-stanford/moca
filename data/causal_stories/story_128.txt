Louie and Claire are playing a game of basketball, and they made a bet with
their friends who are watching on the sidelines. If either Louie makes a
3-point shot or Claire makes a 3-point shot during the game, then they'll win
$100 and split it down the middle. Just when the game started, Louie
immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused
his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie,
Claire, and their friends continued playing, but as hard as they tried, Louie
and Claire couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as
the clock was winding down, Claire got the ball at the 3-point line. She looked
to the basket, focused her shot, and made a 3- point shot right at the buzzer.
Then the game ended. Because they would win $100 if either Louie made a 3-point
shot or Claire made a 3- point shot, Louie and Claire won $100 and split it
down the middle. Think about what could have been different in the story that
you just read. Which event do you imagine happening differently: Louie making
the 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Claire making the 3-point
shot right at the buzzer.
