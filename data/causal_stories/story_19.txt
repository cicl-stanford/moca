Sara has an electric guitar that she plays through an amplifier. The guitar
will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or
the power mixer is turned on. Today, the amplifier is set to channel A. Sara
checks to see if the power mixer is on. She sees that the power mixer is turned
on, and she does not turn off the power mixer or adjust it at all. Because the
guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to
channel A or the power mixer is turned on, Sara's guitar plays through the
amplifier.
