Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a
limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity
only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can
use power on certain days. If two people turn on their lamps at the same time,
the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their
lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their
lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then,
Carol also turns on her lamp. Since two people turned on their lamps at the
same time, the circuit breaker failed.
