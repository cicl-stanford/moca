Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach
an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are
signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is green, so he is
supposed to drive across the bridge immediately. Suzy's signal is green, so she
is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the
bridge is on the verge of collapse. If either of them drives their train onto
the bridge, it will collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break
the bridge. Billy follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge
immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train
onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that
moment the bridge collapses.
