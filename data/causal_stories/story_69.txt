Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message
that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend.
So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for
the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his
friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell
the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part
with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips
the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the
stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and
buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired
set of bookends.
