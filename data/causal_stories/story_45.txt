Billy and Suzy inherited an unusual type of hybrid car that has two special car
batteries called Bartlett batteries. The car won't start unless it has at least
one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start
the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day,
Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house,
and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to
sell the battery to him, but his friend says that he can't sell it because he
needs it for his own car. Billy waits until his friend is in the bathroom, and
then steals the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side
of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that
they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett
battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two
Bartlett batteries. Since all the car needed was at least one Bartlett battery,
they were able to start the car.
