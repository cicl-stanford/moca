The receptionist in the philosophy department keeps her desk stocked with pens.
The administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens, but faculty members
are supposed to buy their own. The administrative assistants typically do take
the pens. Unfortunately, so do the faculty members. The receptionist has
repeatedly emailed them reminders that only administrative assistants are
allowed to take the pens. On Monday morning, one of the administrative
assistants encounters Professor Smith walking past the receptionist's desk.
Both take pens. Later that day, the receptionist needs to take an important
message... but she has a problem. There are no pens left on her desk.
