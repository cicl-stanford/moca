Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll
two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on
his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater
than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll
higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice
and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as
expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins
the game.
