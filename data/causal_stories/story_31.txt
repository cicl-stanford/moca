Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee
flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free
sample if either they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC or they
are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee
beans from GC, and she is subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about
the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and

remains subscribed to the email list. Because customers will receive a free
sample if either they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC or they
