Prof. Smith works at a large university. At this university, in order to get
new computers from the university, faculty like Prof. Smith must send an
application to two administrative committees, the IT committee and the
department budget committee. Prof. Smith will be able to get her new computers
if the IT committee approves her application or the department budget committee
approves her application. Only one of the committees needs to approve her
application for her to get the new computers. The IT committee almost always
approves these applications. The department budget committee almost never
approves these applications. The budget committee is notorious for turning down
almost every application they receive. Prof. Smith sends in her applications.
Each committee meets independently and they decide without talking to each
other, but their meetings are scheduled for the exact same time. The IT
committee approves her application, and surprisingly, the department budget
committee approves her application. So, Prof. Smith got her new computers.
