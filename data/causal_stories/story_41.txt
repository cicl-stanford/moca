Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach
an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are
signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is red, so he is supposed
to stop and wait. Suzy's signal is green, so she is supposed to drive across
immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of
collapse. If either of them drives their train onto the bridge, it will
collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge. Billy
decides to ignore his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately
at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the
bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment
the bridge collapses.
