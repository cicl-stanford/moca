Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a
limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity
only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can
use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same
time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on
their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use
their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just
then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three
people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.
