Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by
implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if either the
safety switch is off or knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is
off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he
sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all.
Because the building will implode if either the safety switch is off or knob A
is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM.

Quedstion: Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?
