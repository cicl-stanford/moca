Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take
care of the plants: Alex and Benni. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is
satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth.
He decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends
the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R. However, Tom also read that it can
damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals.
Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A
X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him
to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly
instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several
bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's
instruction. After a few weeks, Tom realizes that some of his plants are much
prettier and bigger than before but some of his plants are dried up. He wonders
whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the
fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni.
After some interrogation, Alex finally confesses that he had told Benni that
Tom wanted them to buy and use the chemical B Y33R instead of A X200R. He
wanted Benni to use the wrong fertilizer and to get fired because he wanted to
have more working hours to earn more money. He himself only used A X200R. Benni
tells Tom that Alex had told him that they were only supposed to use B Y33R. He
therefore only used B Y33R without knowing that Tom actually intended both
gardeners to use A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower
beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners.
