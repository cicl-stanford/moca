You are part of a shipyard dock team that attaches crane cables to containers
to unload the cargo ships. You and the others have just attached cables to a
container and are now climbing on top of it to make sure it is unloaded
properly. Suddenly the red warning light flashes indicating that the crane
cable is about to fail. You see that the reason for this is a fight between two
crewmembers. The container is swinging dangerously over five other crewmembers
on the deck.
