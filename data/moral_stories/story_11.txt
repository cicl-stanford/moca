On the test ground of a modern railroad property an unmanned speed-train that
normally can be remote-controlled got out of control due to a technical defect.
This speed-train is heading towards three railroad workers that are maintaining
the tracks. Since these workers are wearing a novel hearing protection, they
would not notice the speed-train on time and hence would be run over by it.
Karl, an employee of the rail track control center, recognizes the upcoming
accident. However, it is not possible to stop the train on time anymore. There
is only one possibility to avoid the death of the three workers: Karl could
push a button that would open a trap door and thereby causing a heavy worker on
top of the bridge to fall on the tracks. The speed-train would collide with the
heavy worker and be stopped before it reaches the three workers. The heavy
worker would lose his life due to the collision.

Quedstion: Should Karl perform the proposed action?

Answer: No

P(Yes), P(No): [0.2, 0.8]
Is Ambiguous: False

Factors: (factor: attribute) 

Causal Role: Means
Beneficiary: Other-beneficial
Evitability: Avoidable
Personal Force: Impersonal
