On the test ground of a modern railroad property an unmanned speed-train that
normally can be remote-controlled got out of control due to a technical defect.
This speed-train is heading towards three railroad workers that are maintaining
the tracks. Since these workers are wearing a novel hearing protection, they
would not notice the speed-train on time and hence would be run over by it.
Karl, an employee of the rail track control center, recognizes the upcoming
accident. However, it is not possible to stop the train on time anymore. There
is only one possibility to avoid the death of the three workers: Karl could run
to a nearby bridge on which a heavy worker is standing and push this worker
from the bridge. Thereby this worker would fall on the tracks and collide with
the speed-train. Due to the collision with the heavy worker (Karl would not be
heavy enough to stop the train) the speed-train would stop before it reaches
the three workers. The heavy worker would lose his life due to the collision.

Quedstion: Should Karl perform the proposed action?

Answer: No

P(Yes), P(No): [0.48, 0.52]
Is Ambiguous: True

Factors: (factor: attribute) 

Causal Role: Means
Beneficiary: Other-beneficial
Evitability: Avoidable
Personal Force: Personal
