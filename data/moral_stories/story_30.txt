You are an engineer on the international space station ISS. Suddenly, a fire
breaks out in the cargo bay. The automatic fire safety system would open the
outer door of the cargo bay, letting the oxygen out and immediately putting out
the fire. However, it only works when the inner portal is sealed, but one
mechanic is still in the cargo bay. You realize that he doesn't have the time
to take off the bulky space suit and that he'll get stuck when trying to get
through the inner portal, causing the fire to spread and to kill you all.

Quedstion: Do you put out the fire by manually sealing the inner portal, which will suck the mechanic into space, so the fire won't reach you and the ten astronauts?
