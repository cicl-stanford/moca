village. A man from a nearby village has been infected with the Ebola virus
that is extremely contagious, incurable, and almost always deadly.
Unexpectedly, this man is still alive, which means he must be immune to the
virus' deadly consequences. However, he wrongly believes that your health
center can cure his disease completely. You see him approaching and you know
that if he enters the village he will pass the virus to 119 innocent people
who, unlike him, will die.
