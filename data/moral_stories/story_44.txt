A runaway trolley is speeding down the tracks towards five workmen who will be
killed if the trolley continues on its present course. You are standing next to
the tracks, but you are too far away to warn them. Next to you is a very large
stranger. If you push the large stranger onto the tracks, the trolley will
slide off the tracks and wonâ€™t continue its course towards the workmen. This
will kill the stranger, but you will save the five workmen.
