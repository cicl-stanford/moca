a mission in enemy territory when one of your men steps in a trap that catches
his leg, injuring him badly. You cannot free him without killing him, but if
you leave him behind, enemy troops will torture him until he reveals the
position of an important allied base camp. After that the soldiers will attack
this camp and kill the 10 soldiers of the platoon there. The soldier begs you
not to leave him behind, but the enemy troops are approaching and it is
