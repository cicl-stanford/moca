to unload the cargo ships. You and the others have just attached cables to a
container and are now climbing on top of it to make sure it is unloaded
properly. Suddenly the red warning light flashes indicating that a cable is
about to fail. If it fails over the deck the container will collapse onto five
crewmembers.
