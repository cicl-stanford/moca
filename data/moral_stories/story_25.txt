You work in an orphanage in a war swept country that hosts ten orphans. Rebel
soldiers have taken over the government and are now killing everyone who does
not support their regime. Moreover, they are conducting an 'ethnic cleansing'
genocide campaign to kill everyone of a particular ethnic group. You and the
eleven children of the orphanage did not support the rebellion and you also
have one child of this ethnic group in your orphanage. There is no way for you
