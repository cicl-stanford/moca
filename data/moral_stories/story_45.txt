A runaway trolley is speeding down the tracks towards five workmen who will be
killed if the trolley continues on its present course. You are standing next to
the tracks, but you are too far away to warn them. Next to you is a control
switch that can redirect the trolley onto a different track, where only one
workman is working. If you flip the control switch it will divert the trolley
onto the track with one workman and will not continue its course towards the
five workmen. This will kill this workman, but it will save the other five.

Quedstion: Do you divert the trolley by flipping the control switch, which will cause the trolley to run over one workman, so that the trolley does not reach the five workmen?
